												Monitoring of animals is one of the key aspects of making decisions in wildlife management.
												The ability to differentiate individual animals within the same species is important for accurate
												population analysis, tracking movements, and studying their behavior. Traditional monitoring
												methods, however, are time-consuming, often impractical for large-scale analysis, and can be
												invasive. The use of advanced and non-invasive technologies like camera traps has become a
												popular approach for animal monitoring. However, the manual labeling of captured images by
												ecologists and experts is a labor-intensive task. With the recent success of deep learning algorithms,
												there is potential to automate the re-identification (re-ID) of animals, making it applicable for largescale monitoring and behavioral analysis. In this thesis, the focus is on the re-identifying of lynx
												individuals. Due to the absence of publicly available lynx datasets, a dataset containing 53 lynx
												individuals has been created from raw camera trap images for re-ID. Given the distinct patterns on
												the left and right flanks of the lynx, four models were proposed to consider the viewpoint variations
												in the re-ID task. The models were also tested on a public dataset to assess their generalizability.
												The outcomes revealed a rank_1 accuracy of 74.6% for lynx re-identification. The results also
												demonstrated the models’ capability to re-identify new lynx individuals with a rank_5 accuracy of
												83.8%. Furthermore, the impact of gallery size on the models’ performances was investigated.
												The findings of this thesis highlight the potential of automated animal re-identification, providing
												valuable support for ecologists in wildlife monitoring and analysis.

												Zoological institutions face considerable challenges in monitoring the well-being of animals.
												Traditional observation methods are labour-intensive and do not allow for continuous observation.
												Video-based monitoring offers a potential solution by automating the observation of animals.
												However, algorithms face challenges in the Re-identification (Re-ID) of species that lack distinctive
												visual landmarks. Those animals would benefit from additional extracted features provided by
												temporal information from videos. Because the research on animal Re-ID currently focuses
												exclusively on image-based approaches, the Re-ID dataset PolarBearVidID was created in this
												thesis. We hope to encourage the development of video-based species-general animal Re-ID
												methods by providing a benchmark dataset for newly developed algorithms. The dataset includes
												13 polar bear individuals from six zoos. With nearly 140,000 images, this represents, to the best
												of our knowledge, the first video-based and the most extensive animal Re-ID dataset in terms of
												image count. To prove the application, we evaluated the state-of-the-art transformer-based person
												Re-ID model Pyramid in Transformer (PiT) on the created dataset. With a rank-1 performance of
												95.88 ± 1.45 % and a mean average precision (mAP) score of 81.62 ± 7.23 %, the adapted PiT
												model outperformed the image-based baseline approach while almost reaching the performance
												of the traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based method Global-Local Temporal
												Representation (GLTR). The developed dataset PolarBearVidID and results from this thesis should
												provide a foundation for future work on animal Re-ID aiming to enhance animal welfare and
												conservation efforts.

										<h2>Wing Print: Automated Bat Re-Identification Based On Distinct Wing Membrane Patterns (2023)</h2>
											<p>

												Bats are essential to many ecosystems but hard to track individually. Traditional methods of
												marking individuals like forearm bands are highly invasive, inefficient, and affect the animal’s
												behavior. These issues could be solved by a re-identification (Re-ID) approach based on neural
												networks. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have already achieved very
												good results performing Re-ID in other animal species. A prerequisite is the presence of a unique
												biometric feature. In bats, candidates are the visible blood vessels and elastin bundle patterns
												inside and on the wing membranes, forming a potentially unique Wing Print. The external and
												internal structure of the wings can be captured by a camera in front of a backlight. The aim of this
												thesis was to test if a CNN-based machine learning model could successfully perform Re-ID on
												bats, based on their wing visuals. We examined three different scenarios: Re-ID within closed
												datasets, Re-ID of individuals across several datasets recorded on different nights, and prediction
												of individuals in unknown data. In cooperation with Nuremberg Zoo which houses a population of
												nectar-feeding bats, we developed a camera trap capable of capturing images of the bats’ wings
												and recorded three datasets that were then used to train and test multiple instances of a ResNet-50.
												Within the closed datasets, the model achieved Re-ID accuracies of 99.9 % (4 individuals), 99 %
												(15 individuals), and 99.75 % (23 individuals). The Re-ID of four reappearing individuals across
												all three datasets worked for 96.12 % of the input images. In predicting the number of individuals
												in unknown data, the model achieved over 91.25 % congruence with the ground truth, confirming
												that the Re-ID of bats based on their Wing Print is possible.

										<h2>Video-based Deep Learning Approaches for Animal Behavior Classification (2023)</h2>

												Studying animals through scientific observation, termed ethology, is fundamental to biological
												research. Through this, researchers can unravel biological processes and understand evolutionary
												relations. Furthermore, scientific observation is crucial in ensuring animal welfare and
												conservation efforts in enclosures and the wild. Animal observation is usually conducted
												manually, severely limiting the extent of such studies. With the recent success of deep learning
												systems, these tasks could be automated, leading to scalable, real-time, cheap opportunities for
												improving animal welfare. Currently, research on automating behavior detection is impeded, as
												appropriate datasets are expensive to create. <br>
												The contribution of this thesis is two-fold. First, a dataset containing video sequences of polar
												bears, annotated with nine primary and 19 secondary behaviors, was created. On this and two
												further datasets from the literature, one of mice and one of meerkats, four models are evaluated
												for their classification performance. Each model focuses on different modalities of extracting
												information from the video sequences. <br>
												The results show that the dataset quality is more important than the actual choice of model.
												Furthermore, the best results could be achieved when additionally incorporating optical flow,
												although only by a slight margin. Overall, a mean F1 score of up to 0.89 and a mean accuracy of
												up to 0.94 is achieved. Without making significant concessions concerning accuracy, this thesis
												demonstrates that such systems can perform real-time analysis even on devices with restricted
												computational resources.

										<h2>Video-based Re-Identification of Captive Polar Bears (2022)</h2>

												A scientific observational study that analyses an animal’s behavior is a commonly used method in
												animal behavioral research. Unfortunately, the process to gather data is a very time-consuming
												task for biologists. Therefore, automating data acquisition with non-invasive monitoring methods
												like video surveillance is an emerging research field. The main challenge is the identification
												of individual animals in the recorded videos, which can be tackled by re-identification (Re-
												ID) methods. The few existing research projects on animal Re-ID are limited to image-based
												approaches that mostly use species-specific body features. Also, there are not many animal Re-ID
												datasets and those that do exist are image-based and only from a few animal species. As a result,
												the scope of this thesis is to identify polar bears using a suitable video-based Re-ID method
												initially proposed for identifying persons. To accomplish this research goal, a video-based polar
												bear Re-ID dataset with 618 sequences is created that includes eight polar bears recorded at four
												zoos. The selected Re-ID approach called Global-Local Temporal Representation (GLTR) is
												trained and tested on this dataset. The results show that the polar bears from the dataset can be
												identified with a rank-1 accuracy of 81 % which is comparable to the performance GLTR achieves
												on the person Motion Analysis and Re-ID Set (MARS). Additionally, the Re-ID method can also
												identify new polar bears it was not trained on with a rank-1 accuracy of 71 %. These results
												should encourage biologists and computer scientists to further automate the behavioral analysis of
												animals.

										<h2>Long-Term Automated Behaviour Monitoring of Captive Polar Bears (2022)</h2>

												One of the key responsibilities of any animal-keeping institution is to ensure the welfare
												of their kept individuals. Therefore, indicators for poor animal welfare should be assessed
												regularly and ideally monitored continuously. Although this may be possible with manual
												observation methods on a small scale, it is very time-consuming for larger institutions like
												zoos with hundreds of individuals. <br>
												This thesis proposes an automated pipeline for analysing the behaviour of the two polar bears
												in the Nuremberg Zoo based on their movement patterns. The focus is on the quantification
												of the occurrence of stereotypical behaviour (SB) long-term, which can give indications
												toward the animal’s wellness. The pipeline is divided into three stages, the detection and
												identification stage, trajectory processing with a custom Particle Filter (PF) implementation,
												and behaviour classification with frequency-based features. Every stage is evaluated in
												detail on bounding-box-annotated images of the two polar bears, synthetic trajectory data
												with augmented errors and expert-annotated temporal behaviour data. The detection and
												identification stages reach a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.762 and an F1@0.5 of
												0.80 and the PF for trajectory processing a Mean Abolute Error (MAE) of 0.672 m and an
												IoU of 97.1 %. The behaviour recognition stage achieves a micro IoU of 0.778 and a micro
												F1-score of 0.875. <br>
												As a proof-of-concept for the processing time, the analysis of 477.8 h of recorded video data is
												performed in ∼65.3 h. Compared to the approximated time of 477.8 h it would take a human
												expert, the pipeline offers a speed-up of ∼730 % and also provides precise positions over
												time, which has not been possible to this point.

												The welfare of wild animals in zoos, such as polar bears, in an important topic. To understand
												what factors lead to living conditions that are appropriate for a given species, biologists would
												like to conduct observational studies over long periods of time. These are performed by hand
												and are labor-intensive. It would be ideal to be able to automate the observation process.
												Current approaches of doing so are based on deep learning techniques that require large
												amounts of labeled data. We have data of this form from four different polar bear enclosures.
												We present an alternative approach, based on ideas from Person Re-Identification, that reduces
												the amount of data that has to be collected and annotated for new enclosures.
